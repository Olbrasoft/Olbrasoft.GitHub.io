# jekyll-embed-video
Embed YouTube, Vimeo, Twitch, and Google Drive videos/clips in Jekyll webpages without a plugin. If you are hosting your webpage using GitHub pages, you can't use third party plugins. Here is a method to use "includes" instead of plugins.

See the raw text in `example.md` for a complete example.

## Embed YouTube 

Create a file in your `_includes` folder called `youtubePlayer.html` with this code inside: 

```
<div class="embed-container">
  <iframe
      src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/{{ include.id }}"
      width="700"
      height="480"
      frameborder="0"
      allowfullscreen="">
  </iframe>
</div>
```

Place this snippet inside your .md file where you want to embed your video:

```
{% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.youtubeId %}
```

On the top of your .md file, put the YouTube video ID. You could also put the ID of the video directly.

```
---
youtubeId: putYourIDHere
---
```

## Embed Vimeo

Create a file in your `_includes` folder called `vimeoPlayer.html` with this code inside: 

```
<div class="embed-container">
  <iframe
      src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/{{ include.id }}"
      width="500"
      height="281"
      frameborder="0"
      webkitallowfullscreen
      mozallowfullscreen
      allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</div>
```

Place this snippet inside your .md file where you want to embed your video:

```
{% include vimeoPlayer.html id=page.vimeoId %}
```

On the top of your .md file, put the Vimeo video ID. You could also put the ID of the video directly.

```
---
vimeoId: putYourIDHere
---
```

## Embed Twitch 

Create a file in your `_includes` folder called `twitchPlayer.html` with this code inside: 

```
<div class="embed-container">
  <iframe
      src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip={{ include.id }}"
      height="360"
      width="640"
      frameborder="0"
      scrolling="no"
      muted="false"
      autoplay="false"
      allowfullscreen="true">
  </iframe>
</div>
```

Place this snippet inside your .md file where you want to embed your video:

```
{% include twitchPlayer.html id=page.twitchId %}
```

On the top of your .md file, put the Twitch video ID. You could also put the ID of the video directly.

```
---
twitchId: putYourIDHere
---
```

## Embed Google Drive 

Embedding Google Drive videos have additional steps. 

1. For the desired video, change the link sharing setting to `On - Anyone with the link`. This will make the video accessible to anyone who has the link as no sign-in is required. 
  
  **Important**: If you do not change the video setting to this option, your video will not show.
  
2. Double click the video to show the preview. Click the setting options and select "Open in new window". Now click on the setting option again and select "Embed item". The iframe code should appear. For example:

```
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EC8BnjJMon-vqy-UhLKk9sf_oukZzEbP/preview"></iframe>
```

`1EC8BnjJMon-vqy-UhLKk9sf_oukZzEbP/preview` would be your video ID.

Note: Right clicking the video will not bring up the embed option. You must open the video in a new window. 

Create a file in your `_includes` folder called `googleDrivePlayer.html` with this code inside: 

```
<div class="embed-container">
  <iframe
      width="640"
      height="480"
      src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/{{ include.id }}"
      frameborder="0"
      allowfullscreen="">
  </iframe>
</div>
```

Place this snippet inside your .md file where you want to embed your video:

```
{% include googleDrivePlayer.html id=page.driveId %}
```

On the top of your .md file, put the Google Drive video ID. You could also put the ID of the video directly.

```
---
driveId: putYourIDHere
---
```

## Responsive Videos
For responsive videos that automatically resize with changing window sizes, add in `video-embed.css`.

```
.embed-container {
  position: relative;
  padding-bottom: 56.25%;
  height: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  max-width: 100%;
}

.embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
```

## Iframe Attributes
These attributes are defined in the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe). You can set various additional attributes no matter what provider you use. 

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | --- | --- |
| `allowfullscreen` | boolean | If `true`, the player can go full screen. |
| `height` | integer | Height of the embedded window, in pixels. |
| `width` | integer | Width of the embedded window, in pixels. |
| `scrolling` | boolean | Indicates when the browser should provide a scroll bar (or other scrolling device) for the frame. Recommended: `no`. |
| `src` | string | The video/clip source URL link |
| `autoplay` | boolean | If `true`, the video starts playing automatically, without the user clicking play. The exception is mobile devices, on which video cannot be played without user interaction. Default: `true`. |
| `muted` | boolean | Specifies whether the initial state of the video is muted. Default: `false`. |
| `time` | 1h2m3s | Time in the video where playback starts. Specifies hours, minutes, and seconds. Default: 0h0m0s (the start of the video). |
